            information that can be used to contact or identify you, and may
            include information such as an individual’s name, email address,
            mailing address, telephone number, and payment or bank account
            details (“Personal Information”). When you register an Account, we
            may collect some Personal Information, such as your name, your phone

            commonly used a way for users to log in to sites using their
            accounts with third-party services, such as Google, but without
            exposing their third-party-service passwords to such sites. For a
            Third Party Account that does not support OAuth, we will ask for
            your login credentials for such Third Party Account, which may
            include your email address and password. In all cases, we may
            collect your name and email address and the names and email
            addresses of your email contacts, subject to the terms of this

            credentials from one of your Third Party Accounts, we may access and

            access, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
