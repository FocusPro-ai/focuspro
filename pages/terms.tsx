            or not they authorized that activity. You should immediately notify

            the right to suspend or end the Services at any time, with or
            without cause, and with or without notice. For example, we may
            suspend or terminate your use if you are not complying with these
            Terms, or use the Services in any way that would cause us legal
            liability or disrupt others’ use of the Services. If we suspend or

            repeatedly or flagrantly violating these Terms, a court order, or
            danger to other users) where we may suspend immediately. Although it

            suspended or interrupted, including, without limitation, for
            scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to
            failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Consequently,
            FocusPro.ai encourages you to maintain your own backup of your data.
            In other words, FocusPro.ai is not a backup service, and you agree

            your User Content and other data. Sections 3 through 26 will survive

          </h2>

            User agrees not to use any Confidential Information (as hereinafter
            defined) disclosed to it by us for its own use or for any purpose
            other than to use the Services. User shall not disclose or permit
            disclosure of any Confidential Information to third parties. User
            agrees that they shall take reasonable measures to protect the
            secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information
            in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the
            possession of persons other than those persons authorized under
            these Terms to have any such information. Such measures shall
            include the degree of care that User utilizes to protect its own
            Confidential Information of a similar nature. User agrees to notify
            us of any misuse, misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of
            Confidential Information which may come to User’s attention. If User
            becomes legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information,
            other than pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, User will
            provide us prompt written notice of such disclosure and will assist
            us in seeking a protective order or another appropriate remedy. If
            we waive User’s compliance with this Section or fail to obtain a
            protective order or other appropriate remedy, User will furnish only
            that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally
            required to be disclosed; provided that any Confidential Information
            so disclosed shall maintain its confidentiality protection for all
            purposes other than such legally compelled disclosure. User agrees
            that any violation or threatened violation of these provisions
            related to the use and disclosure of Confidential Information will
            cause irreparable injury to FocusPro.ai, entitling FocusPro.ai to
            obtain injunctive relief in addition to all legal remedies without
            showing or proving any actual damage and without any bond being
            required to be posted.“Confidential Information” means any oral,
            written, graphic or machine-readable information, technical data or
            know-how, including, but not limited to, that which relates to
            patents, patent applications, research, product plans, products,
            developments, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering,
            formulae, markets, software (including source and object code),

            work flows, business plans, agreements with third parties, services,
            and customers, whether or not designated as “confidential” at the
            time of disclosure. Confidential Information shall include
            information disclosed by us before the date User first used our
            Services, but shall not include information that: (i) was publicly
            known or made generally available without a duty of confidentiality
            prior to the time of disclosure to User by us; (ii) becomes publicly
            known or made generally available without a duty of confidentiality
            after disclosure to User by us through no action or inaction of
            User; or (iii) is in the rightful possession of User without
            confidentiality obligations at the time of disclosure by us to User
            as shown by User’s then-contemporaneous written files and records
            kept in the ordinary course of business.

            We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current

            Other changes may be posted to our terms page, so please check that
            page regularly. If a User continues to use the Services after
            revisions become effective, the User agrees to be bound by the
            revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop

            19. Resolving Disputes
          </h2>
          <p className=" font-semibold my-2 text-gray-600">
            Customer service is a priority, but if there’s an issue that needs
            to be resolved, this section outlines what is expected of both of
            us. A. Initial Informal Dispute Resolution. Before filing a claim
            against Routine, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally
            by contacting us via email at focuspro.ai@gmail.com. We will try to
            resolve the dispute by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not
            resolved within thirty (30) days of submission, you or FocusPro.ai
            may bring a formal proceeding. B. Arbitration Agreement. You and
            FocusPro.ai agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or
            the Services, whether or not such claims involve a third party,
            through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under
            Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. Arbitration is more
            informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral
            arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited
            discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by
            courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a
            court can award. This arbitration agreement will survive the
            termination of your relationship with FocusPro.ai. C. Arbitration
            Notification. If either of us intends to seek arbitration under this
            agreement, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other
            party of the dispute in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance
            of initiating the arbitration. Notice to Fo cusPro.ai should be sent
            to us via email to focuspro.ai@gmail.com, with a duplicate copy sent
            via registered mail, return receipt requested, to the mailing
            address specified on our Site. The notice must describe the nature
            and basis of the claim and the relief being sought. D. Prohibition
            of Class Arbitrations. YOU MAY ONLY RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US ON AN
            INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR A
            CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
            Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions,
            and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, the
            arbitrator shall not have the power to determine that class
            arbitration is permissible. The arbitrator also shall not have the
            power to preside over class or collective arbitration, or to award
            any form of class-wide or collective remedy. If for any reason the
            prohibition of class arbitrations set forth above cannot be
            enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply. E.
            Judicial Forum for Disputes. IN THE EVENT THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE
            IS FOUND NOT TO APPLY TO YOU OR YOUR CLAIM, YOU AND FocusPro.ai
            AGREE THAT ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE
            SERVICES OR SOFTWARE MUST BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN ITALIAN COURTS
            OF BOLOGNA, ITALY. BOTH YOU AND Routine CONSENT TO VENUE AND
            PERSONAL JURISDICTION THERE.
